# the basic conception 



# the variable and distribution




# the mutidimensional variable and distribution
## the 2-dimension-variable
- for discrete  
- it also has the probability-function,likes:  
|hi  |x1|x2|x3|..|
|----|----|----|----|----|



## the distribution function of 2 variable
- discrete:
>the Z=X+Y can easily '='
- continuous
1. Z=X+Y
the (X,Y) is the 2-dimension-continuous-variable ,with their probability-function ,the Z alos is continuous-variablie,the probability is  
$f_{x+y}(z)=$  
$  
if the X and Y is indenpent,the **convolution** will appear  
$  
$  
called $f_x*f_y$  
>if the $f_x(x)$ and $f_y(y)$ is a normal-distribution(zheng_tai_fen_bu),X~N($u_1$,$x_1^2$),Y~N($u_2$,$x_2^2$)  
so the Z=X+Y $f_z(z)$ also is a normal-distribution :
Z=aX+bY+...   
$$ Zï½žN(u_1+u_2+...,a^2u_x^2+b^2x_2^2+...)$$

2. the max{X,Y} and min{X,Y}  
the key is to switch the problem to we familiar


# the numerical feature of the variable  
## the average  
1. variable  
for discrete-variable   
E(X)=$\sum_1^\infty{x_kp_k}$  
- 
-
-
-

for continuous  
E(X)=$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)dx$ 
- 
-
-

2. variable-function:`Y=g(X)`   
>X is discrete-variable,the distribution of X is P{X=$x_k$}=$p_k$  
so E(Y)=E[g()]
